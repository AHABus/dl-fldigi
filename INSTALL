A single makefile is used to create various compile strategies for fldigi

	make
		builds fldigi with hamlib support
		
	make clean
		removes all vestiges of prior builds
		
	make CFG=hamlib-debug
		builds fldigi with hamlib support and gdb debug information
		
	make CFG=hamlib-local
		builds fldigi with hamlib support and fltk_jpeg, fltk_png and
		fltk_z compiled into the fltk library
		
	make CFG=nhl
		builds fldigi without hamlib support
		
	make CFG=nhl-debug
		builds fldigi without hamlib supoort but with gdb debug
		information
		
	make CFG=nhl-local
		builds fldigi without hamlib support but with fltk_jpeg, fltk_png 
		and	fltk_z compiled into the fltk library
		
All make's place the object files in ./Objects and the target executable
in ./Install

The ./Install directory also contains icons suitable for both desktop and 
menu use.

Copy the executable file fldigi to a directory that your shell can routinely 
access for executable files.  I have a ~/bin directory that holds all of my 
local executables.

If you plan on using fldigi with pskmail then you should create a separate 
directory with a single file in it to start:
  o PSKmailclient, or PSKmailserver, depending on your desired pskmail 
    service.
  o then you should execute Fldigi from this directory, preferably from 
    a terminal window
    
After first use you will find a $HOME/.fldigi directory created with 
all of the files needed for fldigi to run and be configured.
