Note: In order to build habitat-cpp-connector directly into fldigi, the
includes are both here (so that they are are available to dl-fldigi as
#include "habitat/*.h"), and in dl-fldigi/src/habitat/ via the symlink to
habitat-cpp-connector/src/ (since when the habitat-cpp-connector cpp files
themselves are compiled they expect the headers to be available in the same
directory).
