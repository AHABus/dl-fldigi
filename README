The following development libraries need to be present and installed on 
your system before you compile Fldigi.

1. Fast Light Tool Kit -  FLTK  version 1.1.7 or greater.

   * configure the compilation of Fltk as:  
   
      o ./configure --enable-threads --enable-xft --enable-shared

      o if you do not use the --enable-xft switch you will get segfaults 
        when selecting True Type fonts for display!!

      o if you do not use the --enable-threads the application will not 
        compile and link

      o if you do not have the jpeg, png and zlib libraries on your system 
        you can compile them for local use by fltk.  Add the following to 
        the ./configure line
           --enable-localjpeg 
           --enable-localpng 
           --enable-localzlib
                
   * then simply execute make and make install (make install as super user)
          
2. Hamlib - The hamlib library is required if you plan to interface to
your transceiver using those common libs.  You can also use the fldigi
internal RigCAT controller and avoid the use of hamlib.  If you compile
for hamlib the RigCAT functionality is still compiled into fldigi.
Hamlib Library Source the latest release is 1.2.6, download this release.
Follow the instruction in the source code top directory.  The library must 
be installed as super user.  You should compile as your normal login user.  
The precompiled hamlib RPM and DEB distributions usually work OK.

3. PortAudio - you will need to build and install both libportaudio and 
libportaudiocpp.  See website, www.portaudio.com

4. Sndfile - you will need to build and install libsndfile.  See website,
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile by  Erik de Castro Lopo.  Erik is also
the author of the resampling library that is used in fldigi to compensate
for the sound card offsets.
