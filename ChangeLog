Change Log:

2.01  1) Bug fix release
         a) Throb modems failing to stop with t/r button
         b) Modem startup problem when switching modes.         	  
2.0   1) Increased TxPPM to +/- 50000 to match the RxPPM range
      2) Changed all audio i/o to separate 2 channel control (stereo)
      3) Added right channel CW QRQ signal
      4) Added right channel pseudo FSK signal
      5) Added position and size of main dialog to state memory
      6) Added status and position of rig control dialog to state memory
      7) Added PSKmail tab and control to allow disabling the automatic
         return to the PSK sweet spot if running a mail server
      8) Added "Save To" menu item on received text popup menu.
      9) Corrected memory leak bugs found in version 1.34
      10) Added "Test" capability to save Rx or Tx waveforms in ".wav"
          format and to play them back for testing modem decoders.
      11) Replaced text editing widgets with new widgets capable of cut,
          copy and paste. 
          ===> temporarily disabled pending resolution of cpu% problem
      12) Added new functions on text widget popup menus
      13) Added a QSY undo (right button press)
      14) Added a who is this capability to waterfall -- press right
          button and hold on a signal and decoding occurs on that signal.
          Release and decoding returns to normal tracking point.
      15) This release requires libsndfile, libportaudio and libportaudiocpp
          The new libraries provide portaudio sound card mapping, and the
          ability to save and playback wav files (when fldigi is run as:
          fldigi TEST).
      16) Added Azimuth computation to QRZ query (submitted by WA5ZNU).
      17) Corrected adif file header field <PROGRAMID:6>fldigi
      18) Added fix to psk decoder sync detector.  Thanks to the PocketDigi
          author, Vojtech Bubnik, OK1IAK.
      19) Added popup menu (right click) to the lower left corner modem button.
          Allows quick change on psk modes only.  Left button still opens up
          the configuration tab for the modem in use.
      20) Changed QRZ.com query to XML registered user query, see QRZ config-
          uration tab.
      21) Added grunner and boost libraries.  These separate the modem threads
          from the gui thread.  This provides a considerable improvement in
          modem performance.
      22) Restored the new text editing widgets and also retained the fast
          text widgets that do not have full editing capability.  User can
          select which of the text widgets will be used.  Default is the fast
          text widget.  An fldigi restart is required after making a change to
          the widget selection on the "misc" configuration tab.
      23) Multiple changes to hamlib interface to correct deficient behavior on
          startup and when changing frequency.
      24  Changes to several modem code structures associated with qrunner
          implementation.
      25) Text widgets support additional text styles:
		  	 NATTR : FOREGROUND_COLOR
			 XMIT  : FL_RED  - used in Rx widget to show Xmt'd text
			 CTRL  : FL_DARK_RED - used in Rx/Tx widgets for control chars
			 SKIP  : FL_BLUE - used in Rx/Tx for skipped chars (eg: Tx ON/OFF)
			 ALTR  : FL_DARK_GREEN - used in Rx widget for quick view of signal
			         when right-clicking on a waterfall signal
      26) Added additional control/mode commands to the pskmail/ARQ SYSV message
          queue processor.  Mode command strings are now:
             CW          : <cmd><mode>CW</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX4  : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX4</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX5  : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX5</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX8  : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX8</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX11 : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX11</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX16 : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX16</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX22 : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX22</mode></cmd>
             MFSK8       : <cmd><mode>MFSK8</mode></cmd>
             MFSK16      : <cmd><mode>MFSK8</mode></cmd>
             PSK31       : <cmd><mode>PSK31</mode></cmd>
             PSK63       : <cmd><mode>PSK63</mode></cmd>
             PSK125      : <cmd><mode>PSK125</mode></cmd>
             PSK250      : <cmd><mode>PSK250</mode></cmd>
             RTTY        : <cmd><mode>RTTY</mode></cmd>
             TUNE        : <cmd><mode>PTTTUNE</mode></cmd>
               this will cause fldigi to enter the TUNE mode for a very brief
               100 milliseconds.
      27) Abandoned the original fldigi.def configuration file and changed to
          an xml based configuration file.  New file is $HOME/.fldigi/fldigi_def.xml
          You may delete all occurances of 
              $HOME/.fldigi/fldigi.def, and
              $HOME/.fldigi/FLDIGI_XML.DEF
          Future changes to the configuration should never require deleting the old
          configuration file.
          You will need to reconfigure and save the program configuration the 
          first time the new version of fldigi is executed.
      28) Added numerous command line switches which control the look and feel.
          use "fltk --help" from a terminal window to view the switch options.

1.34  1) Cleaned up unused code segments
      2) Modified CW decoder to allow setting upper and lower limits on
         Tx WPM
      3) Modified sound card PPM corrections to allow a +/-50000 range.
         Prompted by some users reporting ppm requirements exceeding
         25,000 ppm at 8000 Hz sample rate.  Same card gives < 200 ppm
         at 11025.
      4) Modified the combo widget to allow both editable and non-editable
         forms.
         The combo widget for the rig selection cannot be edited, but just
         selected from the pick list.
         The combo widget for the frequency entry (no rig control) in the 
         qso area can now be modified by direct keyboard entry and also 
         from the pick list.  You still need to update the pick list via
         the $HOME/.fldigi/frequencies.def file.
      5) Modified pskmail to test for failure in reading gmfsk_autofile
      6) Wholesale replacement of font browser dialog to correct potential
         segfaults with some TT fonts.
      7) Modified pskmail-to-fldigi i/o schema to allow all control and
         data files to be placed in either the 
         	$HOME/pskmail.files or the 
         	./ directory.
         The control files are:
         	PSKmailserver
         	PSKmailclient
         The data files are:
         	pskmail_out (formerly gmfsk_autofile)
         	mail-io.log (formerly gMFSK.log)
1.33  1) Modified Sound Card mixer dialog and interface code
      2) Modified CW decoder and morse speed tracking algorithm with a
         new CW configuration tab layout and new CW controls.
      3) Source code includes all required #ifdef & #define statements
         for compiling on FreeBSD

1.32  1) Correct compile problem for 64 bit compiler
      2) Minor bug fix for Olivia initialization

1.31  1) Correct problem with cpu% in CW modem during transmit idle 
         (no keyboard activity)

1.30  1) New macro definitions with built-in editor
      2) loadable waterfall palettes
      3) all qso's saved to the log are appended to an ADIF file in the 
         $HOME/.fldigi folder
      4) significantly improved Psk decoder
      5) significantly improved DominoEX decoder    capable of decoding signals 
         anywhere within a 400 Hz bandwidth without AFC

1.24  1) Bug fix for serial i/o to disable XON/XOFF protocol effected 
         rigs with binary i/o for rig control

1.21  1) Corrects bug in RigCtl dialog for PTT selection on serial line

1.20  1) Improved rig control and rig control dialog. Now possible to 
         control rig without using hamlib - this is a new paradigm and you 
         should read the on-line help that explains how to use the rigCAT 
         control interface.  rigCAT extended markup language definition files
         can be downloaded from the xml archives
      2) improved WWV calibration procedure
    
1.11  1) Added items to saved configuration
            a. view transmit signal preference
            b. send ID preference
      2) Corrected failure to properly change sound card selection after 
         initial program settings
      3) Internal changes to improve rx/tx thread processing

1.10  1) Added QRZ lookup for logging
      2) Updated CW / FSK keyling output, added UART generated FSK signals
      3) Added auto-logger macro reference to macro definitions
      4) Online and download help updated for current version
