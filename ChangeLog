Change Log:

1.36  1) Increased TxPPM to +/- 50000 to match the RxPPM range
      2) Changed all audio i/o to separate 2 channel control (stereo)
      3) Added right channel CW QRQ signal
      4) Added right channel pseudo FSK signal
      5) Added position and size of main dialog to state memory
      6) Added status and position of rig control dialog to state memory
      7) Added PSKmail tab and control to allow disabling the automatic
         return to the PSK sweet spot if running a mail server
      8) Added "Save To" menu item on received text popup menu.
      9) Corrected memory leak bugs found in version 1.34
      10) Added "Test" capability to save Rx or Tx waveforms in ".wav"
          format and to play them back for testing modem decoders.
      11) Replaced text editing widgets with new widgets capable of cut,
          copy and paste. 
          ===> temporarily disabled pending resolution of cpu% problem
      12) Added new functions on text widget popup menus
      13) Added a QSY undo (right button press)
      14) Added a who is this capability to waterfall -- press right
          button and hold on a signal and decoding occurs on that signal.
          Release and decoding returns to normal tracking point.
      15) This release requires libsndfile, libportaudio and libportaudiocpp
          The new libraries provide portaudio sound card mapping, and the
          ability to save and playback wav files (when fldigi is run as:
          fldigi TEST).
1.34  1) Cleaned up unused code segments
      2) Modified CW decoder to allow setting upper and lower limits on
         Tx WPM
      3) Modified sound card PPM corrections to allow a +/-50000 range.
         Prompted by some users reporting ppm requirements exceeding
         25,000 ppm at 8000 Hz sample rate.  Same card gives < 200 ppm
         at 11025.
      4) Modified the combo widget to allow both editable and non-editable
         forms.
         The combo widget for the rig selection cannot be edited, but just
         selected from the pick list.
         The combo widget for the frequency entry (no rig control) in the 
         qso area can now be modified by direct keyboard entry and also 
         from the pick list.  You still need to update the pick list via
         the $HOME/.fldigi/frequencies.def file.
      5) Modified pskmail to test for failure in reading gmfsk_autofile
      6) Wholesale replacement of font browser dialog to correct potential
         segfaults with some TT fonts.
      7) Modified pskmail-to-fldigi i/o schema to allow all control and
         data files to be placed in either the 
         	$HOME/pskmail.files or the 
         	./ directory.
         The control files are:
         	PSKmailserver
         	PSKmailclient
         The data files are:
         	pskmail_out (formerly gmfsk_autofile)
         	mail-io.log (formerly gMFSK.log)
1.33  1) Modified Sound Card mixer dialog and interface code
      2) Modified CW decoder and morse speed tracking algorithm with a
         new CW configuration tab layout and new CW controls.
      3) Source code includes all required #ifdef & #define statements
         for compiling on FreeBSD

1.32  1) Correct compile problem for 64 bit compiler
      2) Minor bug fix for Olivia initialization

1.31  1) Correct problem with cpu% in CW modem during transmit idle 
         (no keyboard activity)

1.30  1) New macro definitions with built-in editor
      2) loadable waterfall palettes
      3) all qso's saved to the log are appended to an ADIF file in the 
         $HOME/.fldigi folder
      4) significantly improved Psk decoder
      5) significantly improved DominoEX decoder    capable of decoding signals 
         anywhere within a 400 Hz bandwidth without AFC

1.24  1) Bug fix for serial i/o to disable XON/XOFF protocol effected 
         rigs with binary i/o for rig control

1.23  1) Bug fix for saving state of PTT selection between sessions

1.22  1) Fixes serial i/o problem with certain rigs in the Icom series

1.21  1) Corrects bug in RigCtl dialog for PTT selection on serial line

1.20  1) Improved rig control and rig control dialog. Now possible to 
         control rig without using hamlib - this is a new paradigm and you 
         should read the on-line help that explains how to use the rigCAT 
         control interface.  rigCAT extended markup language definition files
         can be downloaded from the xml archives
      2) improved WWV calibration procedure
    
1.11  1) Added items to saved configuration
            a. view transmit signal preference
            b. send ID preference
      2) Corrected failure to properly change sound card selection after 
         initial program settings
      3) Internal changes to improve rx/tx thread processing

1.10  1) Added QRZ lookup for logging
      2) Updated CW / FSK keyling output, added UART generated FSK signals
      3) Added auto-logger macro reference to macro definitions
      4) Online and download help updated for current version

1.04  1) Fixes a hamlib shutdown problem for some rigs transceiver should 
         be ON and connected before starting fldigi and during fldigi shutdown

1.03  1) Improvements to pskmail server operation

1.02  1) Added user defined band definition file (info at: Freq Def File)

1.01  1) Fixes a memory leak problem

1.00  Initial release
